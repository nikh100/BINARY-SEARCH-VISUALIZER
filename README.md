**BINARY SEARCH VISUALIZER**

# Project Document

## Tech Stack

### Technologies and Tools Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the web page.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and functionality for the binary tree visualization.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Concepts and implementation for creating and manipulating binary search trees (BST).

## Project Details

### Overview

The Binary Tree Visualization project is an educational tool designed to help users understand the structure and operations of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The web application provides an interactive interface for visualizing the insertion, deletion, and search operations within a BST. The project also includes informative sections about BSTs, explaining their properties, operations, and traversal methods.

### Features

1. **Interactive Binary Tree Visualization**: Users can insert, delete, and search for nodes within the BST, with real-time visual feedback.
2. **Sound Effects**: An audio element is used to provide sound feedback on successful node insertions.
3. **BST Information Section**: Comprehensive information about BSTs, including their properties, operations, and traversal methods.
4. **Examples with Images**: Visual examples of Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals to help users understand different traversal methods.
5. **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.

### Functionalities

- **Insert Node**: Allows the user to input a value and insert it into the BST. The tree is updated visually, and a sound effect is played upon successful insertion.
- **Delete Node**: Enables the user to remove a node with a specific value from the BST. The tree is updated to reflect the deletion.
- **Search Node**: Allows the user to search for a node with a specific value in the BST. The application alerts the user whether the node is found or not.
- **Visual Feedback**: The BST visualization updates dynamically as nodes are inserted, deleted, or searched. Lines and nodes are drawn using SVG elements.
- **Informative Content**: The BST information section includes detailed explanations and visual examples to aid in understanding.

### Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the web page and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **style.css**: Defines the styling and layout of the web page.
- **binaryTree.js**: Implements the logic for the binary tree operations and visualization.
- **insert_sound.mp3**: Audio file for the insertion sound effect.
- **Images**: Visual examples of different traversal methods (preorder, inorder, postorder) in GIF format.

### Additional Project Ideas

- **Binary Search Visualization**: Extend the project to include visualizations for binary search operations.
- **Interactive Code Examples**: Add interactive code examples to explain the implementation of BST operations.
- 
This project serves as an educational tool to help users understand the concepts of Binary Search Trees through interactive visualizations and informative content.
